## Privacy Policy

PrivacyBreacher doesn't send any information that it collects. The information will be stored in your phone's memory (RAM) and all that collected information will be lost once you exit from the app.

PrivacyBreacher has only requests for FOREGROUND_SERVICE permission to run a foreground service and it can be noticed in your notifications.

The main purpose of PrivacyBreacher is to showcase privacy issues in Android. PrivacyBreacher doesn't exploit any bugs as the issues we mention in our [article](https://github.com/databurn-in/Android-Privacy-Issues) work as intended and cannot be considered as security bugs.
